# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository is dedicated to documenting the principles, practices, and application of requirement analysis in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).

It serves as a structured learning project where key concepts such as requirement gathering, functional vs. non-functional requirements, use case diagrams, and acceptance criteria are explored and documented.

The goal of this repository is to provide clarity, precision, and professional documentation standards that emulate real-world software development scenarios.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) where the needs, expectations, and constraints of stakeholders are gathered, analyzed, and documented. It focuses on answering the question: _“What should the system do, and under what conditions should it operate?”_

This process involves identifying **functional requirements** (what the system should do, such as features and behaviors) and **non-functional requirements** (how the system should perform, such as security, performance, and scalability).

### Importance in the SDLC

1. **Foundation for Development** – Clear requirements serve as the blueprint for designers, developers, and testers, ensuring that everyone works toward the same goal.
2. **Minimizes Errors and Rework** – Well-documented requirements reduce misunderstandings, preventing costly changes later in the development cycle.
3. **Alignment with Business Goals** – Ensures the system meets both user needs and organizational objectives.
4. **Facilitates Communication** – Acts as a common language between stakeholders, developers, and project managers.
5. **Scope Management** – Helps define project boundaries and prevents scope creep by clarifying what is and isn’t included.

In essence, Requirement Analysis bridges the gap between the **problem domain** (what stakeholders need) and the **solution domain** (what developers build), making it a cornerstone for successful software projects.
