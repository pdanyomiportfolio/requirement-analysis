# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository is dedicated to documenting the principles, practices, and application of requirement analysis in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).  

It serves as a structured learning project where key concepts such as requirement gathering, functional vs. non-functional requirements, use case diagrams, and acceptance criteria are explored and documented.  

The goal of this repository is to provide clarity, precision, and professional documentation standards that emulate real-world software development scenarios.
