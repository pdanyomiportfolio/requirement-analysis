# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository is dedicated to documenting the principles, practices, and application of requirement analysis in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).

It serves as a structured learning project where key concepts such as requirement gathering, functional vs. non-functional requirements, use case diagrams, and acceptance criteria are explored and documented.

The goal of this repository is to provide clarity, precision, and professional documentation standards that emulate real-world software development scenarios.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) where the needs, expectations, and constraints of stakeholders are gathered, analyzed, and documented. It focuses on answering the question: _“What should the system do, and under what conditions should it operate?”_

This process involves identifying **functional requirements** (what the system should do, such as features and behaviors) and **non-functional requirements** (how the system should perform, such as security, performance, and scalability).

### Importance in the SDLC

1. **Foundation for Development** – Clear requirements serve as the blueprint for designers, developers, and testers, ensuring that everyone works toward the same goal.
2. **Minimizes Errors and Rework** – Well-documented requirements reduce misunderstandings, preventing costly changes later in the development cycle.
3. **Alignment with Business Goals** – Ensures the system meets both user needs and organizational objectives.
4. **Facilitates Communication** – Acts as a common language between stakeholders, developers, and project managers.
5. **Scope Management** – Helps define project boundaries and prevents scope creep by clarifying what is and isn’t included.

In essence, Requirement Analysis bridges the gap between the **problem domain** (what stakeholders need) and the **solution domain** (what developers build), making it a cornerstone for successful software projects.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is one of the most crucial steps in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) because it lays the groundwork for building successful software. Without it, projects risk delays, misunderstandings, or failure to meet user expectations. Below are key reasons why Requirement Analysis is critical:

1. **Prevents Miscommunication**  
   Requirement Analysis ensures that developers, testers, and stakeholders share a common understanding of the system’s goals. This reduces ambiguity and avoids costly mistakes caused by unclear expectations.

2. **Saves Time and Cost**  
   Identifying requirements early helps detect potential issues before development begins. This minimizes rework, reduces project risks, and saves resources in the long run.

3. **Defines Clear Scope**  
   It establishes what is included (and excluded) in the project. This prevents _scope creep_ and keeps the project focused, ensuring timely and successful delivery.

4. **Aligns with Business Objectives**  
   Requirement Analysis ensures that the system being developed directly supports the organization’s goals and adds real value to end-users.

5. **Improves Quality of the Final Product**  
   By specifying both functional and non-functional requirements, Requirement Analysis ensures the software is not only feature-rich but also reliable, secure, and user-friendly.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Requirement Analysis involves a series of activities that ensure software requirements are well understood, documented, and validated. The five key activities are:

- **Requirement Gathering**  
  Collecting initial information about the system from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, observations, and existing documentation. This step focuses on understanding what users need.

- **Requirement Elicitation**  
  Engaging with stakeholders to refine and clarify requirements using techniques like brainstorming, workshops, prototyping, and questionnaires. The goal is to uncover both explicit and implicit needs.

- **Requirement Documentation**  
  Recording requirements in a clear and structured manner using tools such as Software Requirement Specification (SRS) documents, user stories, and use case diagrams. This serves as a reference for the development team.

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**  
  Analyzing gathered requirements to identify conflicts, redundancies, and feasibility. Visual models such as data flow diagrams (DFD), entity-relationship diagrams (ERD), and use case diagrams are created to illustrate system behavior.

- **Requirement Validation**  
  Reviewing and confirming requirements with stakeholders to ensure they are complete, consistent, and aligned with business goals. This helps detect gaps and ensures that the documented requirements meet user expectations.
